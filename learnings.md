# Sports Data Platform — Learnings

Accumulated patterns, anti-patterns, and insights from scraping, analysis, and prediction work.

## Accumulated Principles

- Always log scrape results immediately, even failures — the log is the audit trail
- ESPN undocumented API endpoints may change; validate response structure before parsing
- Rate limiting is non-negotiable — free APIs will ban aggressive scrapers permanently
- Two-source corroboration is the minimum for any published prediction
- Statistical significance without practical significance is noise
- The ratchet loop only works if the improvement metric is well-defined before iteration begins
- Dev mode exists for speed; flip to gated mode before any real predictions are shared
- Schema validation at the TypeScript/Python bridge catches drift before it poisons models

## Per-Session Reflections

### espn-first-scrape (2026-04-04)
- **KEEP**: Generic `scrapedFetch<T>()` pattern — adding new endpoints is a one-liner
- **KEEP**: JSONL append logging — 6 entries auto-logged with zero manual effort
- **IMPROVE**: ESPN `/teams` endpoint doesn't return `groups` (conference/division) — need `/teams?limit=100` or the standings endpoint instead
- **INSIGHT**: ESPN API responds fast (<600ms teams, <30ms scoreboard) — rate limit of 60/min is generous for our use case
- **INSIGHT**: NFL offseason = only 1 game on scoreboard; need historical endpoints for meaningful analysis data
- **TEST CAUGHT**: `import.meta.dirname` works in Node 22+ with tsx but would fail in older runtimes

### sprint2-sqlite-cron-cli (2026-04-04)
- **KEEP**: better-sqlite3 works with build-essential present — native bindings are fast and synchronous
- **KEEP**: Upsert pattern (INSERT ON CONFLICT UPDATE) handles re-scrapes cleanly — no duplicate team/game records
- **KEEP**: CLI tables with box-drawing characters — scannable at a glance, zero dependencies
- **KEEP**: Scheduler with retry logic — `withRetry()` generic is reusable across all scrapers
- **IMPROVE**: `npx tsx -e` inline eval doesn't resolve ESM paths — use file-based scripts only
- **INSIGHT**: Full 3-sport scrape cycle completes in 1.3s — well within any cron interval
- **INSIGHT**: SQLite WAL mode + foreign keys pragma should be set on every connection open
- **INSIGHT**: Odds API free tier returns events with multiple bookmakers — using first bookmaker is fine for MVP but should aggregate later

### sprint3-outcomes-mapping-bdl (2026-04-05)
- **KEEP**: Auto-resolving game outcomes in the scheduler cycle — 28 results resolved automatically on first run
- **KEEP**: Team mapping table with canonical_id + provider — clean pattern, extensible to all sports
- **KEEP**: Inspect CLI with multiple subcommands (mappings, results, home-rate) — immediate data visibility
- **KEEP**: BallDontLie cursor-based pagination with rate delay — clean resumable pattern
- **IMPROVE**: BallDontLie free tier is only 5 req/min (not 60) — historical ingest will be slow (~12.5s per page)
- **INSIGHT**: NBA home win rate from 9 games = 55.6%, already near historical average (~57-60%)
- **INSIGHT**: Spread/OU results only computable when odds are attached — most current games have no odds without Odds API key active
- **INSIGHT**: Team name mapping is trivial for NBA (names match across providers) but will be harder for soccer (different naming conventions)
